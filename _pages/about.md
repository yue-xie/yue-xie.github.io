Welcome to my website! Currently I am a research assistant professor in Musketeers Foundation Institute of Data Science and Department of Mathematics at the University of Hong Kong. Before that, I was a postdoc at Wisconsin Intitute for Discovery and lucky to work with Professor [Stephen J. Wright](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/). I received my PhD degree in Pennsylvania State University when I was fortunate to have Professor [Uday V. Shanbhag](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/shanbhag-uday-v/) as my supervisor and thesis advisor. My research interests are continuous, stochastic and robust optimization, with all types of applications including machine learning and data science. You may find more about me in my [CV](https://yue-xie.github.io/files/CV_2025.pdf).

## News

Sep 17, 2025: Our work on Tackling High-Dimensional Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization via Stochastic First-Order Methods with Non-smooth Proximal Terms and Variance Reduction has been on arXiv ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13992)). This work includes significant improvement over the previous one ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19475)) in many aspects. Behind the improved outcomes are persistent exploration motivated by pursuit of math completeness, and invaluable disucssions with ingenious scholars. I personally like the work and the story behind it very much.
